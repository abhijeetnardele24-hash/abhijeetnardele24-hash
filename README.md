I’m a 2nd year Computer Science student at VIT Pune. I like working on real projects and learning things by building applications instead of only focusing on theory.



I’m interested mainly in full stack development and application-based work.

Technologies I work with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB
- Git and GitHub

Currently, I’m trying to:
- Improve my problem-solving skills
- Get better at backend logic
